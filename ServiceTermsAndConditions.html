                                  ><br /><br />If you purchased the Equipment
                                  from Hughes with your HughesNet Service,
                                  Hughes warrants that under normal use and wear
                                  the Equipment purchased by you from Hughes and
                                  used to access the Service, which may include
                                  the satellite modem, multipath device, power
                                  supplies, wireless antenna (indoor) and
                                  satellite antenna &amp; radio (outdoor), will
                                  be free from defects in material and
                                  workmanship for a standard limited warranty
                                  term of 24months from the date of activation.
                                  Any Equipment replaced or repaired under this
                                  warranty will be warranted for the remainder
                                  of the original warranty period or thirty (30)
                                  days, whichever is longer. This warranty is
                                  not transferable. If under normal use and
                                  wear, the Equipment becomes defective in
                                  materials or workmanship during the warranty
                                  period set forth above, Hughes shall at its
                                  option and expense, perform one of the
                                  following:<br /><br />– We will repair or
                                  replace the defective Equipment within thirty
                                  (30) days of the date the defective Equipment
                                  was returned to Hughes’ designated address at
                                  your expense, to cause it to comply with the
                                  terms of this Limited Warranty. Reconditioned
                                  replacement components, parts, units or
                                  materials may be used if the Equipment is
                                  repaired or replaced.<br /><br />– If service
                                  to the satellite antenna and radio is
                                  required, Hughes will, at its expense, repair
                                  or replace it pursuant to the limited warranty
                                  for the first six months after installation.
                                  From six months to the end of your limited
                                  warranty period, Hughes will cover the cost of
                                  the replacement equipment, but the cost of the
                                  onsite service technician visit, if necessary,
                                  will be paid by you. You may request a price
                                  estimate prior to the work, based on the type
                                  of the replacement. If your satellite antenna
                                  needs to be re-pointed after the first 6months
                                  of service, a standard onsite visit fee will
                                  be charged to you. Reconditioned replacement
                                  components, parts, units, or materials may be
                                  used if the Equipment is repaired or
                                  replaced.<br /><br />– We may upgrade the
                                  Equipment to a later-generation product that
                                  performs the same function and complies with
                                  the terms of this Limited Warranty.<br /><br />THESE
