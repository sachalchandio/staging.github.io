                                Yes, when the contract period has passed, Hughesnet services may be terminated without
                                penalty. However, there may be an early termination fee that applies and could be as
                                much as $400 if the cancellation request is made before the contract expiration. After
                                the first 90 days following activation, this charge is reduced by $15 per month. To be
                                eligible for this discount, your account must be active.
